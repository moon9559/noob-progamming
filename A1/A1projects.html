            <article><h1>Some of my projects</h1>
                <p>These are some of the projects that i have worked on or want to make in the future as i get better with coding</p>
                
                <section><h2> Past Projects</h2>
                    <p>One of my past larger projects I worked on was creating a game of hangman for an assignment, I worked with a classmate to code the game with roughly 120 lines of code. 
                        Although that felt like a huge project then, looking back it looks like nothing compared to whats to come.</p>

                <section> <h2> Future projects</h2>
                    <p> In the future I plan on using what im learning to help my dad build a product of sorts related to motors, he currently works with arduino and wants to switch to python.
                        I wanna be able to do this work but my current understanding of coding in general could use some touching up.
                    </p>
